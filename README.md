# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the TensorFlow Functional API to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.The performance is evaluated using test accuracy, classification report, and a heatmap-style confusion matrix.
