## CNN-BASED IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING TENSORFLOW FUNCTIONAL API
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the TensorFlow Functional API to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The performance is evaluated using test accuracy, classification report, and a heatmap-style confusion matrix.


## TOOLS USED
-Programming Language: Python

-Libraries:
*TensorFlow / Keras (Model building)

*NumPy (Numerical operations)

*Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

*Scikit-learn (Evaluation metrics)

-Dataset: CIFAR-10 (built into Keras datasets)

## APPLICATIONS
-Automatically classify X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans to detect diseases such as pneumonia, tumors, or fractures.

-Used in surveillance systems, biometric authentication, and security checks.
